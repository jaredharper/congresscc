# congressSite

This is the generically named repo holding the source code for http://con.gress.cc

The raw data is from https://www.govtrack.us/developers/data.  Govtrack.us has a huge collection of house/senate data available for free.

The site itself is a relatively straightforward Spring Boot app deployed to Heroku.  The backend code is located in /src/main/java and the frontend code is all located in /src/main/webapp.
